# The Foreman Workflow: Multi-Agent Architecture for Complex Refactoring

## Overview

The **Foreman + Specialist multi-agent workflow** is a structured approach to managing complex, multi-phase refactoring projects. Instead of trying to do everything directly, it creates a **hierarchical agent system** where:
- **1 Foreman agent** = Strategic planner and coordinator
- **Multiple Specialist agents** = Tactical executors with domain expertise

Think of it like a construction project: The foreman doesn't personally install every pipe and wire—they analyze the building, create work orders, and delegate to specialists (plumber, electrician, etc.).

---

## The Workflow Architecture

### Step 1: Foreman Analysis Phase

When starting a new phase, launch the **Foreman agent** with a prompt like:

```
You are the Foreman coordinating Phase 4: ViewModel Refactoring.

Analyze the codebase and create 3-5 detailed work orders.
Each work order should specify:
- Exact files to modify
- Lines of code to extract
- Technical requirements
- Success criteria
- Risk assessment
```

**What the Foreman Does:**
1. **Reads files** to understand current state (e.g., read DeliveryViewModel.kt - 1,160 lines)
2. **Identifies patterns** (e.g., "Lines 87-274 are model pre-warming logic")
3. **Creates work orders** with surgical precision:
   - VM-401: Extract lines 87-274 → ModelPreWarmingService
   - VM-402: Extract image processing → ImageProcessingService
   - VM-403: Extract focus classification → FocusClassificationService
   - etc.
4. **Assesses risks** (High/Medium/Low)
5. **Estimates effort** (2-3 hours per work order)

**Why This Works:**
- The Foreman has a **bird's-eye view** of the entire phase
- Creates a **systematic plan** before any code changes
- **No ad-hoc refactoring**—everything is intentional

---

### Step 2: Specialist Execution Phase

Once the Foreman creates work orders, launch **Specialist agents** to execute them:

```
You are the ViewModel Specialist executing WORK ORDER VM-401.

Task: Extract ModelPreWarmingService from DeliveryViewModel

Requirements:
- Create new file: ModelPreWarmingService.kt
- Extract lines 87-274 from DeliveryViewModel
- Use Hilt @Singleton injection
- Maintain exact functionality
- Build must succeed

Execute this work order and provide final report.
```

**What Each Specialist Does:**
1. **Reads the target file** (DeliveryViewModel.kt)
2. **Extracts the code** with surgical precision
3. **Creates the new service file** (ModelPreWarmingService.kt)
4. **Updates the ViewModel** to use the service
5. **Tests the build** (`./gradlew assembleDebug`)
6. **Creates 2 commits**:
   - Commit 1: Create service file
   - Commit 2: Update ViewModel to use service
7. **Reports results** (files changed, line counts, build status)

**Why This Works:**
- Each specialist is **hyper-focused** on ONE work order
- Has **explicit instructions** (not vague goals)
- **Validates success** with build verification
- **Autonomous execution**—doesn't need to ask questions mid-task

## Real Example: Phase 5 UI Consolidation

### Foreman Analysis (UI-501)
```
FOREMAN ANALYSIS:
- CompletionScreen.kt and PaletteCompletionScreen.kt
- Both have IDENTICAL drawCompletionAnimation() function (68 lines each)
- Total duplicate: 136+ lines
- Animation logic: circle → checkmark → text (3 stages)

WORK ORDER CREATED: UI-501
Title: Extract Completion Animation Component
Files: CompletionScreen.kt (222 lines), PaletteCompletionScreen.kt (218 lines)
Create: CompletionAnimation.kt
Estimated Reduction: ~190 lines per screen (85% reduction)
Risk: Low
```

### Specialist Execution
```
UI SPECIALIST EXECUTING UI-501:

1. Read CompletionScreen.kt → identified lines 50-218 (animation logic)
2. Read PaletteCompletionScreen.kt → identified lines 45-213 (EXACT DUPLICATE)
3. Created CompletionAnimation.kt (262 lines with docs)
   - AnimatedCompletionOverlay composable
   - DrawScope.drawSuccessAnimation() extension
4. Updated CompletionScreen.kt → reduced 222 → 33 lines (85% reduction)
5. Updated PaletteCompletionScreen.kt → reduced 218 → 29 lines (87% reduction)
6. Built successfully (3 seconds)
7. Committed: 997c4b1

RESULT: Eliminated 379 duplicate lines, created reusable component
```

## Why This Workflow Is So Effective

### 1. Separation of Planning vs. Execution
- **Foreman**: "What should we do and in what order?"
- **Specialist**: "How do we execute this specific task?"
- Never trying to plan AND code at the same time

### 2. Context Management
Each agent has a **focused context**:
- Foreman only analyzes, doesn't write code
- Specialist only executes ONE work order
- No context pollution from unrelated tasks

### 3. Explicit Success Criteria
Every work order has measurable goals:
- ✅ Files created/modified (with line counts)
- ✅ Build successful
- ✅ Commits made
- ✅ Functionality preserved

The specialist knows **exactly when they are done**.

### 4. Autonomous Execution
Once launched, specialists:
- Read files independently
- Make implementation decisions
- Run builds
- Create commits
- Report back

No micromanagement needed—just launch and wait for the report.

### 5. Work Log Tracking
The `.claude/agents/state/work-log.json` file acts as:
- **Project management system** (20/25 work orders complete)
- **Audit trail** (who did what, when)
- **Progress tracker** (Phase 4: 5/5 work orders done)
- **Metrics dashboard** (436 logs migrated, 531 lines eliminated)

## Comparison: Traditional vs. Foreman Workflow

### Traditional Approach (Ineffective):
```
Developer: "Refactor DeliveryViewModel"
AI: *starts reading file*
AI: "This is 1,160 lines... um... let me extract... this part?"
AI: *writes some code*
AI: "Wait, I should also extract this other part..."
AI: *gets confused about what they're doing*
AI: "Actually, let me think about the architecture first..."

Result: Messy, incomplete, lots of back-and-forth
```

### Foreman Workflow (Effective):
```
Developer: "Continue with Phase 4"
AI: *launches Foreman*
Foreman: Creates 5 detailed work orders (VM-401 through VM-405)
AI: *launches ViewModel Specialist for VM-401*
Specialist: Executes VM-401, reports success
AI: *launches ViewModel Specialist for VM-402*
Specialist: Executes VM-402, reports success
... (repeat for all 5 work orders)

Result: Clean, systematic, complete, tracked
```

## Key Insights

### 1. Work Orders Are Like Compiler Directives
They're **precise specifications**, not vague goals:
- ❌ "Clean up DeliveryViewModel" (vague)
- ✅ "Extract lines 87-274 to ModelPreWarmingService.kt, reduce ViewModel by 178 lines, build must succeed" (precise)

### 2. Agents Don't Get Overwhelmed
Each agent sees **only their task**:
- Foreman doesn't see code details (just structure)
- Specialist doesn't see the big picture (just their work order)
- No cognitive overload

### 3. Built-In Quality Control
Every work order has:
- Success criteria (must reduce by X lines)
- Build verification (must compile)
- Commit requirements (2 commits per work order)

If any fail, the specialist reports it for investigation.

### 4. Parallelizable (If Needed)
Because work orders are independent, you can:
- Run VM-401, VM-403, VM-405 in parallel
- Run UI-501, UI-503, UI-505 in parallel

This architecture supports parallel execution when needed.

## How It Actually Works (Behind the Scenes)

There's no actual multi-agent system running. Here's what really happens:

1. **Use the Task tool** to launch "agents"
2. **Each Task invocation** creates a fresh context with:
   - Role: "You are the Foreman/Specialist"
   - Goal: Specific work order
   - Tools: Read, Write, Edit, Bash, etc.
3. **The agent executes** autonomously with those tools
4. **Reports back** with a structured summary
5. **Parse the summary** and move to the next work order

It's like **role-playing different personas**, where each persona has:
- A specific job title (Foreman, ViewModel Specialist, etc.)
- A specific task (analyze Phase 4, execute VM-401, etc.)
- A specific context (only sees what's relevant to their task)

### Workflow Steps

1. **Define Phases**
   - Break project into logical phases (Infrastructure, ML, UI, etc.)
   - Each phase should have a clear goal

2. **Launch Foreman for Phase Analysis**
   ```
   Prompt: "You are the Foreman coordinating Phase X: [Name].
           Analyze the codebase and create 3-5 detailed work orders."
   ```

3. **Review Work Orders**
   - Foreman creates work orders with risk assessment
   - Review and approve before execution

4. **Execute Work Orders with Specialists**
   ```
   Prompt: "You are the [X] Specialist executing WORK ORDER [ID].
           [Detailed requirements]
           Execute this work order and provide final report."
   ```

5. **Track Progress**
   - Update work-log.json after each work order
   - Track metrics (files changed, lines added/removed, etc.)

6. **Verify Between Phases**
   - Build verification after each work order
   - Comprehensive testing between phases

## Use Cases for This Workflow

This workflow is ideal for:

- ✅ **Large refactoring projects** (extracting services, splitting monoliths)
- ✅ **Multi-file migrations** (updating API calls across many files)
- ✅ **Feature implementations** (touching many files systematically)
- ✅ **Technical debt cleanup** (consistent patterns across codebase)
- ✅ **Logging framework migrations** (like we did: 436 log calls)

## Tips for Success

### For the Foreman Phase:
1. Give enough context about the project goals
2. Specify the number of work orders desired (3-5 is ideal)
3. Ask for risk assessment and effort estimation
4. Request specific file paths and line numbers

### For the Specialist Phase:
1. Include the full work order in the prompt
2. Specify build verification requirements
3. Request structured final reports
4. Require commits after each work order

### General Best Practices:
1. Execute work orders sequentially (not in parallel) unless you're confident
2. Verify builds after each work order
3. Update work-log.json frequently
4. Review specialist reports before proceeding
5. Keep work orders focused (single responsibility)

---

## Conclusion

The Foreman workflow transforms chaotic refactoring into a **systematic, trackable, successful process**. By separating planning (Foreman) from execution (Specialists) and using precise work orders, you can tackle massive codebases with confidence.

The key insight: **Complex problems become simple when broken into small, well-defined tasks.**
