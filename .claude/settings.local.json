      "Bash(gemini \"I''m working on a portfolio website with a tile-based navigation system. I need to add a SECRET 6th tile (Dev tools) that''s hidden from public visitors but accessible to the owner. The constraints are:\n\n1. Must be mobile-friendly (touchscreen)\n2. Must be truly hidden (no visible UI hints)\n3. Must not interfere with existing tile navigation/clicking\n4. Tiles use click to navigate/expand\n5. Current attempt (triple-tap) is failing - it only works once, shows illegible text on first tap, then reverts after 0.5 seconds\n\nWhat are the BEST practices for hidden easter egg triggers on mobile web? Please search for proven patterns that work reliably on touchscreens. Consider:\n- Long press (how long is ideal?)\n- Tap patterns (corners? specific sequence?)\n- Multi-touch gestures\n- Time-based interactions\n- URL parameters or keyboard shortcuts\n\nWhich approach is most reliable and won''t conflict with normal click/tap interactions?\")",
      "Bash(gemini \"The user rejected all our ideas. Let me give you the KEY CONSTRAINT we keep missing:\n\n**The tiles ALREADY have click actions (navigation)**. We can''''t use tile clicks/taps/sequences.\n\nThe user wants something:\n1. IMPRESSIVE to demonstrate (wow factor)\n2. Works on desktop AND mobile\n3. Doesn''''t interfere with existing tile clicks\n4. NOT the navbar (they said it''''s ''''not very clean'''')\n5. Simple to code\n\n**What we CAN''''T use:**\n- Tile clicks/taps (already used for navigation)\n- Swipe on tiles (conflicts with scroll)\n- Long-press on tiles (conflicts with text selection)\n- Triple-tap on tiles (OS conflicts)\n- Navbar taps (user doesn''''t like it)\n\n**What ARE we left with?**\n\nI''''m thinking:\n1. **Keyboard shortcut** - Press a key combo like Ctrl+Shift+D (or Cmd+Shift+D on Mac)\n   - Pro: Universal, no conflicts, easy to demo (''''watch, I press this combo...'''')\n   - Con: Doesn''''t work on mobile keyboards\n\n2. **Favicon click** - Click the favicon/logo in the browser tab\n   - Pro: Unusual, impressive\n   - Con: Can we even detect this? Might not be possible\n\n3. **Scroll pattern** - Scroll down, then up, then down quickly\n   - Pro: Works on mobile and desktop\n   - Con: Might conflict with normal browsing\n\n4. **Background click** - Click the empty space BETWEEN tiles in a specific spot\n   - Pro: Doesn''''t interfere with tiles\n   - Con: Hard to aim on mobile\n\nWhat do YOU think? What''''s a genuinely impressive trigger that doesn''''t use the tiles themselves?\")",
