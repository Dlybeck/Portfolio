# AgentBridge: Specify Command

Create a feature specification for AgentBridge.

## Instructions

You are creating a feature specification for: **$ARGUMENTS**

1. Create the feature directory at `.agentbridge/features/{feature-name}/` where `{feature-name}` is a kebab-case version of the feature description.

2. Create `spec.md` in that directory using this structure:
   - **Overview**: What this feature does and why
   - **User Scenarios**: 2-3 user stories with acceptance criteria (Given/When/Then format)
   - **Requirements**: Functional requirements with FR-### numbering
   - **Success Criteria**: Measurable outcomes with SC-### numbering
   - **Assumptions**: Any assumptions about the implementation

3. Focus on WHAT not HOW:
   - Describe user-facing behavior, not implementation details
   - Use plain language a non-developer could understand
   - Make requirements testable and unambiguous

4. After creating the spec, output a summary of what was created.
