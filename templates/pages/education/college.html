          <b>Maroon Society</b> (<a class="link" href="https://www.facebook.com/PugetSoundMaroonSociety/">Link</a>)
          <br>
          The Maroon Society is a university organization that focuses on interaction between students and alumni. They mostly put on events around campus that both students and alumni can enjoy, many focusing on the connections that are made while at these events. I have also been a part of this since my first semester at UPS.
